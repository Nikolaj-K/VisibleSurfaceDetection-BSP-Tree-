# VisibleSurfaceDetection-BSP-Tree-
Implementation of BSP tree and other algorithms used for visibility determination
This is an attempt to write simplistic version of BSP tree and partition the space.
Render the object is back to front or front to back order.
Here we chose random polygon from the list as starting point for partition sometimes called as auto partition.
