# VisibleSurfaceDetection-BSP-Tree
This is an implementation of BSP tree and other algorithms used for visibility determination.

It is an attempt to write a simplistic version of a BSP tree and partition the space.
Rendering order for the object is either back to front or front to back.

We chose a random polygon from the list as starting point for partition. 
This sometimes also called an auto partition.
